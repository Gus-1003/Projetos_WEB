            Hello darkness, my old friend
            I've come to talk with you again
            Because a vision softly creeping
            Left its seeds while I was sleeping
            And the vision that was planted in my brain
            Still remains
            Within the sound of silence
        </p>
        <p>
            In restless dreams I walked alone
            Narrow streets of cobblestone
            'Neath the halo of a street lamp
            I turned my collar to the cold and damp
            When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
            That split the night
            And touched the sound of silence
        </p>
        <p>
            And in the naked light I saw
            Ten thousand people, maybe more
            People talking without speaking
            People hearing without listening
            People writing songs that voices never share
            No one dared
            Disturb the sound of silence
        </p>
        <p>
            "Fools" said I, "You do not know
        Silence like a cancer grows
        Hear my words that I might teach you
        Take my arms that I might reach you"
        But my words like silent raindrops fell
        And echoed in the wells of silence
        </p>
        <p>
            And the people bowed and prayed
        To the neon god they made
        And the sign flashed out its warning
        In the words that it was forming
        </p>
        <p>
            And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
        Are written on the subway walls
        And tenement halls
        And whispered in the sounds of silence"
        </p>
